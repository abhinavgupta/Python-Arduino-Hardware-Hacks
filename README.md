Arduino-Sketches
================

A Compilation of some special Arduino sketches. Will include occasional Python Integration.

Some of my most common work will include :

1. A live data plotting from Arduino. (Can be used for general serial devices as well). This is python based.

2. Function for accuracy to n decimal points. (Arduino does not provide an inbuilt function in case a higher accuracy is needed)

3. Special I2C library for sensors having 2 wire communication

4. Remote Arduino uploading, allows to use ZigBee or other wireless modules to upload a code over the air. (Working)

5. Other hacks from time to time.


P.S : One of my previous arduino hacks to develop MODBUS (Standard RS 485) protocol for arduino is a seperate repo.
