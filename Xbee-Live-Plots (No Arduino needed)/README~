TempSensor
----------
This is a simple live plotting code for XBee. The hardware setup includes two XBees and a temp sensor connected to the end device's ADC. NO ARDUINOS OR OTHER CONTROLLERS

The transmission although AT in nature, the data packets are in the API I/O frame format. We use the xbee-python library for ease in the data parsing.

Source for xbee-python : http://code.google.com/p/python-xbee/

Using monitor.py, a client computer with the other XBee connected can plot the temperature data transmitted by the Router AT wirelessly.

You need:
 - PyQt
 - PyQwt
 - PySerial

Python modules for this to work correctly.

Note that the serial port is hardcoded in SerialMonitor.py, change it to fit your needs. (USE: 'dmesg|tail' on Linux to know what the serial port is, just after connecting your XBee device). Other things hardcoded in this file is the conversion of ADC data to temperature value using a Look Up Table. The temperature measurement in query is a thermistor hence the setup. If you have a LM35 you just need to map the voltage to the temperature value instead of going through the entire process. I have marked the part which is special to my need in the code.

The Plotter application is a simplified/modified version of Eli Bendersky's
